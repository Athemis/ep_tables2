Add Tables in Etherpad-Lite
---------------------------

Initial project (but dead & broken) from Gideon (https://github.com/gedion/ep_tables)
I decided to take over and improve it.

The plugin is available in English & French for now.
If you want another language, take the locales/en.json file and translate it (it's not big).

TODO:
* Ask the export system to call the plugin to create tables in exported files
(If you have any idea how to do this, please let me know)
