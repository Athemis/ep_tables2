Initial project from Gideon (@github)

But unfortunately, it's dead and broken..
I decided to make it works again and improve certain things.

There are still 2 important things to do, but for the time beoing, I don't have a clue how to do it:
* Ask the timeslider to call the render function in order to have the tables there
* Ask the export to call my plugin to create tables in exported files

If you have any idea how to achieve this, please contact me.

v0.2.0
- Fix to make it work again
- Add https support by having yahoo library locally as online yahoos libraries have serious access problems
- Borders have all the same size
- Fix timeslider Bug (thanks to DanBeard - https://github.com/DanBeard)
- Added Bold, Italic, Underline & Font familiy styles & Removed Padding (not working correctly)
- Dimension in + for the table & px for the others
- Initial Width set to 100%
- Second click on menu close the menu
- Menu is closed after clicking on the matrix to create a table
- Fix 'Enter' key that broke the row
