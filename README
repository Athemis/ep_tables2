Initial project from Gideon (@github)

But unfortunately, it's dead and broken..
I decided to make it works again and improve certain things.

There are still 2 important things to do, but for the time being, I don't have a clue how to do it:
* Ask the timeslider to call the render function in order to have the tables there
* Ask the export to call my plugin to create tables in exported files

If you have any idea how to achieve this, please contac me or open a ticket.

The plugin is available in English & French for now.
If you want it in another language, take the locales/en.json file and translate it (it's not big).
